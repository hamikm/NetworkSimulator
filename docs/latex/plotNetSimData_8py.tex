\subsection{Detailed Description}
In Network Simulation project for Caltech C\-S 143, the following metrics are measured and then graphed as a time trace and overall average. For each link\-: link rate (Mbps), buffer occupancy (is this one per link?), packet loss. For each flow\-: flow rate, window size, packet delay. The simulator records data into a .json file, from which data is extracted and graphed.

For each subplot in each window (Link Metric, Flow Metric), the viewer can choose which data set to view by clicking on the associated line 'symbol' in the subplot's legend. This feature is most helpful when comparing link flow rates, since the data sets all overlap and become hard to make sense of.
